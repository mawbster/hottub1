<a href="https://hireahottub.netlify.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/mawbster/hottub1/blob/master/img/ht11small.png"/></a>

<p> first iteration of the hottub site </p>
<ul>
<p>Skills used</p>
  <li>Basic HTML</li>
  <li>Basic css</li>
  <li>javascript animations</li>
  <li>Image linking</li>
  <li>Image selection and adjustments</li>
</ul>

<p>The first iteration of a landing page.</p>
<p>I was able to put into practice some of the basic html i had previously learnt in order to create this.</p>
<p>Using images sent to me by the recipient of the website i had to make adjustments to the sizes and orientation in photoshop to make them fit</p>
<p>Used some tutorials To learn about javaspript animations and how to animate elements of the page for transition effects</p>
<p>I noticed that v1 of this site was very poorly optimised for mobile so made that a specific goal in the next project</p>
<p>Leant about using background images across the site for effects</p>
<p>Created the site from scratch using the a code editor</p>

<p> In conclusion i found this site to be a very good start to using my basic skills to design and create a functional page, I knew it would not be erfect but it would give me a starting point to work towards to find out what i needed to learn more about.</p>
